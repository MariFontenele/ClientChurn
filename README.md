# ClientChurn
Combining a Machine Learning algorithm prediction with business strategies to reduce the client churn rate

**The company is a bank** that operates primarily in Europe. **Their main product is a bank account** which clients can keep their salary and make payments. Owning this account **doesn't have any cost in the first 12 months**. However, the client needs to **rehire the bank** for the upcoming 12 months **after the free trial expires** as well as **everytime this new 12 months hired also expires**. Recently, the Analytics team noticed that the ***churn rate* of clients is *steadily increasing***

Financial data is based on **client's Estimated Salary** and it is yearly based:
- Clients above average: *returns **3%** of their Estimated Salary*
- Clients below average: *returns **5%** of their Estimated Salary*

Worried about this new growing rate of churn clients, the **Data Science team has the challenge to create an action plan to reduce the churn rate of clients and show the financial return of the initiative**. Clients that **don't rehire the bank** after the free trial or after their last renovation **are considered churn**

The **business and marketing plan to keep clients** is to offer a **discount cupom** to incentive clients stay at the bank and the **budget is $10.000,00**. Therefore, the **Data Science team** needs to **develop a Machine Learning model to predict potencial churns** and **then choose a business strategy** to offer discounts that **maximaze ROI - Return on investmemt**
